# ButtonHandler-stm32
A lightweight C library for STM32 microcontrollers to handle button inputs with debouncing, press counting, and timeout detection. Supports configurable pull-up/down modes and uses software timers for reliable button press detection in embedded systems. Ideal for counting single, double, or multiple presses within a specified time window.
